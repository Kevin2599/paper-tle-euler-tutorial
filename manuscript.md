Euler deconvolution
was first developed by @Thompson1982
under the name "EULDPH".
It was later extended
and given its current name
by @Reid1990.
Since then,
it has been extended and improved upon
by @Keating1998,
@Barbosa1999,
@Zhang2000,
@Silva2001,
@Mushayandebvu2004,
@Florio2013,
and @Melo2013,
to name a few.

* Why would anyone care about the topic? How is it applied?

Maps of gravity and magnetic data
provide good constraints on
the horizontal location of an anomaly source.
Euler deconvolution is
a fast and simple technique
that is able to add
an extra dimension to
the interpretation.
It conveniently estimates
a set of (x, y, z) points
that ideally fall inside
the source of the anomaly.
Additionally,
extensions to Euler deconvolution
are able to estimate a parameter
called the *structural index* (SI)
of the source.
This structural index is a number
that is related to
the ideal form of the source.
For example,
in the case of total field magnetic anomaly data,
a sphere is represented by an SI of 3,
whereas a dike is represented by an SI of 1.
Thus,
the structural index can tell us
to which ideal geometric shape
the source is closest.

* If there was just one key thing to know, what would it be?

Recall that Euler deconvolution
estimates points that
ideally fall somewhere inside the source.
Where, exactly,
depends on the kind of source.
For spheres,
the points fall close to the center of mass.
For dikes and vertical cylinders (pipes),
the points fall along the top.
For a geologic contact,
it's somewhere in the middle.
Keep in mind, though,
that these are the *ideal* locations
for simple sources.
In reality,
sources are often far from ideal
and estimated points will
present a spread from these locations
by varying amounts.

* What’s an error you often see people make?

We emphasize that
Euler deconvolution solutions
**do not** represent
the three-dimensional outline
of the sources.
This is a common mistake among novices
and is made worse by
an overconfidence in the results.
It is crucial to remember that
Euler solutions are subject to
non-uniqueness and bias
just like any other geophysical inverse problem.

* What do you wish you’d known when you got into the subject?

* What helped you ‘get it’, or helps you conceptualize the problem?

# An example with synthetic data

The best way to
make these claims evident
is to apply the deconvolution
in a controlled setting
using synthetic (or modeled) data.
These tests are critical to
fully grasp the usefulness and limitations
of any geophysical method.
To make things more interesting,
we'll apply the deconvolution
on data generated by a model
that differs slightly from ideal sources.

* What are the 3–5 most important things to read next?

* How can you illustrate a pertinent aspect of your ‘one thing to know’?
