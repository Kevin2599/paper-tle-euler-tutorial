In this tutorial
we'll talk about
a widely use method
of interpretation for potential field data
called Euler deconvolution.
Our goal is to
demonstrate its usefulness
and, most importantly,
call attention to
common pitfalls encountered
in the interpretation of the results.
The code and synthetic data
required to reproduce our results and figures
can be found in
the accompanying IPython notebooks
(**ipython.org/notebook**)
at **github.com/pinga-lab/paper-tle-euler-tutorial**.
The notebooks also expand
the analysis presented here.
We encourage you to download the data
and try it on your software of choice.
For this tutorial we'll use
the implementation in
the open-source Python package
Fatiando a Terra (**fatiando.org**).

### Brief overview

Euler deconvolution
was first developed by @Thompson1982
under the name "EULDPH".
It was later extended
and given its current name
by @Reid1990.
Since then,
it has been adapted and improved upon
by @Keating1998,
@Mushayandebvu2004,
and many others.
This popularity is largely due to its
the great simplicity of
implementation and use,
making it the tool of choice for
a quick initial interpretation.

In many cases,
maps of gravity and magnetic data
(and transformations thereof)
provide good constraints on
the horizontal location of an anomaly source.
Euler deconvolution is
able to add an extra dimension
to the interpretation.
It estimates
a set of (x, y, z) points
that, ideally, fall inside
the source of the anomaly.
The deconvolution requires
the x-, y-, and z-derivatives of the data
and a parameter called the *structural index* (SI).
The SI is a number (usually integer)
that is related to
the homogeneity of the potential field
and varies for different fields and source types
[@Stavrev2007].
For example,
in the case of total field magnetic anomaly data,
a sphere is represented by an SI of 3,
whereas a dike is represented by an SI of 1.
There are methods
that can estimate the SI
and we refer the reader to
@Barbosa1999
and
@Melo2013
for more information.

### An example with synthetic data

The best way to
fully grasp the usefulness and limitations
of any geophysical method
is to apply it in a controlled setting
using synthetic (or modeled) data.
To make things more interesting,
we'll apply the deconvolution
on data generated by a model
that differs slightly from ideal sources
(Figure 1).

Let's see how
we can use Fatiando a Terra to
run the deconvolution on our data.
The first we need
is to calculate
the 3 directional derivatives
of the potential field.
For gridded data,
this can be done
with the Fourier transform
using module `fourier`
from Fatiando.
Assuming that the data
has been loaded into
Numpy arrays `x`, `y`, `z`
with the respective x-, y-, z-coordinates of each data point
and `data` with our magnetic data
(see the accompanying notebook):

    from fatiando.gravmag import fourier
    from fatiando import utils
    # Need data in SI units
    data_si = utils.nt2si(data)
    # shape = (ny, nx) number of points in y and x
    dx = fourier.derivx(x, y, data_si, shape)
    dy = fourier.derivy(x, y, data_si, shape)
    dz = fourier.derivz(x, y, data_si, shape)

Now that we have the derivatives,
we have to create a solver to run the deconvolution.
Fatiando provides the `Classic` solver
which uses the whole dataset
to estimate a single point
(assuming a single source).
The usual strategy for multiple sources,
introduced by @Reid1990,
is to use a *moving window* over the data.
A point is estimated
for each window using
the data that fall inside it,
producing a large number of solutions.
The challenge then becomes
filtering out the good solutions
from the spurious ones.
@FitzGerald2004 provide
an overview of different selection criteria.
Fatiando provides
the `MovingWindow` solver
that can run a given Euler solver
on a moving window:

    from fatiando.gravmag.euler import Classic, MovingWindow
    classic = Classic(x, y, z, data_si, dx, dy, dz, struct_index)
    solver = MovingWindow(classic, windows=(50, 50), size=(1000, 1000))
    solver.fit()

Calling `solver.fit()` runs the deconvolution
using the specified $50 \times 50$ windows of size 1 km.
The estimated points are stored
in the `solver.estimate_` variable.
See the accompanying notebook
for a more detailed explanation.

For comparison,
we ran the deconvolution
using various different combinations
of structural index and window size.
Figure 2 shows
scatter plots of the solutions
(the typical way Euler solutions are presented).
Notice how changing the window size
influences the spread of the solutions
and can affect our interpretation.
For example,
for a 1 km window and structural index 3,
we cannot tell apart
the two model bodies in the left.
In general,
increasing the structural index
will increase the depths of the solutions.

We can view these solutions in 3D
using the Fatiando module `myv`,
a wrapper for the Mayavi visualization software
(**code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi**):

    from fatiando.vis import myv
    myv.figure()
    myv.points(solver.estimate_)
    myv.axes(myv.outline(model_bounds))
    myv.show()

This will create
something similar to Figure 3.
It is curious how the sources
make arch-like structures
that have no relation to
the actual forms of the sources.

### Last few words of caution

We repeat here for emphasis:
Euler deconvolution solutions
**do not** represent
the three-dimensional outline
of the sources.
They indicate, at most,
an approximate location.
It is crucial to remember that
Euler solutions are subject to
non-uniqueness and bias
just like any other geophysical inverse problem.
Tests using synthetic data
are indispensable to assert
the plausibility of our interpretations.
